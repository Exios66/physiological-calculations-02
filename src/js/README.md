# JavaScript Implementation

This directory will contain the JavaScript implementation of the physiological metrics calculator, providing web-based visualization and analysis capabilities.

## Planned Features

- Interactive web dashboard for physiological data visualization
- Real-time data processing and analysis
- Exportable reports and visualizations
- Integration with wearable device APIs

## Development Status

The JavaScript implementation is currently in planning stages. The Python implementation in `src/python/` serves as the reference implementation for the algorithms and analysis methods.

## Getting Started (Future)

Once implemented, the JavaScript version will be usable via:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
