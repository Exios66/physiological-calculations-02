# Cognitive Workload and Physiological Correlation Analysis

## Cognitive Workload Spikes and Physiological Correlation:

1.	16:27:00 - 16:29:05
* Duration: 2 minutes 5 seconds
* Max Pulse Rate: 115 bpm
* Lowest SpO₂: 82% (moderate hypoxemia)
* Significance: Workload stress event coincided with a hypoxemic episode and tachycardia, suggesting high cognitive effort under physiological strain.
2.	16:37:30 - 16:39:05
* Duration: 1 minute 35 seconds
* Max Pulse Rate: 125 bpm
* Lowest SpO₂: 95.6%
* Significance: Peak pulse rate of 125 bpm indicates a high-stress workload moment despite normal oxygen levels. Likely increased mental exertion.
3. 16:56:25 - 16:58:15
* Duration: 1 minute 50 seconds
* Max Pulse Rate: 109 bpm
* Lowest SpO₂: 84% (moderate hypoxemia)
* Significance: Hypoxemia paired with tachycardia suggests physiological and cognitive workload overload.
4. 17:39:45 (Brief spike)
* Duration: Instantaneous
* Max Pulse Rate: 103 bpm
* Lowest SpO₂: 94.7%
* Significance: Minor stress-related spike; possibly a reaction to an external cognitive stimulus.
5. 17:48:20 - 17:49:55
* Duration: 1 minute 35 seconds
* Max Pulse Rate: 123 bpm
* Lowest SpO₂: 95.4%
* Significance: Another high-workload event with elevated heart rate but normal oxygenation, indicating intense cognitive activity.
6. 17:56:40 - 18:00:15
* Duration: 3 minutes 35 seconds
* Max Pulse Rate: 110 bpm
* Lowest SpO₂: 94.0%
* Significance: Prolonged elevated workload correlating with sustained physiological stress markers.

## Summary & Insights:

•	Two workload spikes coincide with hypoxemia and tachycardia, likely indicating severe cognitive stress.
•	Four other periods show elevated pulse rates (>109 bpm), suggesting cognitive effort without hypoxemia.
•	Gaze fixation, blink suppression, and pupil dilation indicate cognitive stress synchronization.
•	Potential causes: Decision-making pressure, high attention demand, or task complexity spikes.

🔍 Actionable Insight:
Monitoring workload-induced physiological stress is crucial. These repeated cognitive overload episodes may warrant adjustments in task complexity, stress management, or workload distribution. ￼
