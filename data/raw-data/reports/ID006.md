## Key Trends
* SpO₂ Range:
  * Normal range: 92–99% (observed for ~90% of recordings)
  * Lowest values: 80% (at 4:55 PM, 5:03 PM, and 5:55 PM)
## Pulse Rate Range:
* Normal range: 80–100 bpm (observed for ~70% of recordings)
* Elevated values: Peaked at 114 bpm (at 4:55 PM and 5:03 PM)
### Notable Episodes
1. Severe Hypoxemia
   * 4:55 PM to 5:03 PM:
   * SpO₂ dropped to 80% (duration: ~8 minutes)
   * Pulse rate spiked to 114 bpm (compensatory tachycardia).
   * Recovery: SpO₂ gradually returned to 95–98% by 5:06 PM.
2. Moderate Hypoxemia
   * 5:13 PM to 5:16 PM:
   * SpO₂ declined to 87%, paired with pulse rate 104 bpm.
   * Stabilized to 98% by 5:17 PM.
3. Sustained Elevated Pulse
   * 5:22 PM to 5:53 PM: Pulse rate remained elevated (93–106 bpm) despite SpO₂ staying near-normal (97–98%). Suggests possible physiological stress unrelated to oxygen saturation.
### Summary
* Critical events: Three distinct hypoxemic episodes (SpO₂ ≤ 87%), all accompanied by tachycardia.
* Stability: SpO₂ remained ≥92% for most readings, with pulse rates typically within normal limits.
* Actionable insight: The repeated dips to 80% SpO₂ warrant clinical review to rule out equipment error or underlying respiratory/cardiovascular issues.
