## Summary & Insights:

•	Two distinct moderate hypoxemia episodes were identified, with SpO₂ dipping to 82% and 84%, both accompanied by tachycardia.
•	Multiple instances of sustained elevated pulse rates, including a peak of 125 bpm, even when SpO₂ levels were within normal range.
•	The longest sustained elevated pulse episode lasted 4 minutes 55 seconds (17:56:40 - 18:01:35), suggesting possible prolonged stress or exertion.
•	The repeated SpO₂ dips and accompanying tachycardia may indicate underlying respiratory/cardiovascular issues or physiological stress.
