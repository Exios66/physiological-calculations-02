## Summary & Insights:

* Two moderate hypoxemia episodes were detected, with SpO‚ÇÇ dropping to 82% and 84%, accompanied by tachycardia.
* Multiple sustained elevated pulse rate episodes, peaking at 125 bpm.
* The longest sustained elevated pulse episode lasted 3 minutes 35 seconds (17:56:40 - 18:00:15), indicating prolonged physiological stress.
* Frequent SpO‚ÇÇ dips and accompanying tachycardia suggest a need for further evaluation of potential breathing irregularities, cardiovascular responses, or external stress factors.

üîç Actionable Insight:
Given the recurring oxygen saturation drops and tachycardia, additional monitoring or clinical review is recommended to rule out underlying respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, as well as potential environmental influences affecting stress and cognitive workload.¬†Ôøº
